# parliament - reference data

These files are reference data for the Wikidata British Politicians project - https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_British_Politicians

A short script pulls down the reference data from github and live data from the Wikidata Query Service, and compares them. Any discrepancies are flagged up. The reference data can then be updated if necessary, or changes to the live data corrected.
